1. Hosting
I used GitHub pages to host my webpage. GitHub pages is a free hosting service
provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub
repository.
2. Innovation
My virtual cv includes modern web design principles like soft edges and implementing
smooth scrolling for enhanced user experience.
3. Web Technologies
• HTML: Used to create the structure of my webpage.
• CSS: Used to enhance the visual appearance of my site.
• JavaScript: A programming language that I used to enabled interactive features
on my website, such as smooth scrolling and the dynamic display.
4. Compatibility
My website is responsive, meaning it displays correctly on various screen sizes and
work across different browsers.
5. Navigation
I have implemented a clear navigation menu that links to the different sections. This
allows potential employers to easily access the content they are interested in. I included
a "Back to Top" button that further enhances navigation by allowing users to quickly
return to the top of the page after scrolling down.
